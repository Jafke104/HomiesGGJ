Scout:Wh- Where am I?
Sam:You're in your room! You had a heart attack and fell on the floor!!
Scout:My room... I never left...
Scout:...
Scout:I guess it's my time now
Sam:*sniffles*
Scout:No tears Sam... my time... has come... I'll be with Carly/Pierre soon enough...
Sam:*sobs* But I don't want to see you go!
Scout:We all come and go, Sam... but before I go... There's... something I must tell you...
Sam:What?
Scout:In your life, you may lose your way, your sense of self will spin out of control, and you'll lose sight of what your goals truly mean.
Scout:When that happens remember those closest to you, those that you've made connections with. They are your support, your motivation, your resolve, and sometimes... exactly what you've been looking for all along
