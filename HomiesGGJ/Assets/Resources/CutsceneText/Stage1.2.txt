????:Hi ho traveller! 
Scout:Hi! Nice to meet you!
Pierre:The honour is all mine! Pierre Maximilien François Marie Giles at your service. By the looks of it, you're on your way to crafting a new home!
Scout:Indeed, it's rough work though I think maybe I should take a break.
Pierre:NONSENSE! Never stop until your goal is reached. My sweet Monsieur, you must understand you must let nothing stop you!
Scout:I agree that I must reach my goal, maybe you're right…
Pierre:Of course I'm right!!! Listen here, boy-o! You finish your house quick, and if you do, I'll buy you a drink and I'll travel with you as your personal assistant!
Scout:Hm, I'll need to think about it…
